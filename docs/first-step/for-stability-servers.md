# Best Linux Distros for Stability / Servers

For server environments, critical infrastructure, or users who demand absolute reliability and long-term support, stability is paramount. These distributions prioritize tested, robust software over bleeding-edge features.

| Distribution      | Base          | Key Features (for Stability/Servers)                                                                             | Best For                                                                                                    |
