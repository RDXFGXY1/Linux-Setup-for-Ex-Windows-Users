# Choosing the Right Linux Distribution

One of the most powerful—and sometimes confusing—things about Linux is that there isn't just one "Linux." There are hundreds of different versions, called **distributions** (or "distros").

A distribution is the complete operating system built around the Linux kernel. It includes the graphical environment, system tools, and a package manager for installing software.

## Which one is right for you?

The "best" distribution depends entirely on your needs, your experience level, and the kind of work you want to do. This guide is broken down into common use cases to help you make an informed decision.
